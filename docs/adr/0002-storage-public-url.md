# 0002 - Storage Public URL Strategy

- Status: PROPOSED
- Deciders: Team
- Date: 2025-12-12

## Context
Instagram publishing requires that media be hosted at a publicly accessible URL when publishing a media container. We need a storage approach that consistently returns stable public URLs for JPEG assets generated by Gemini or preexisting sources.

## Options
- Amazon S3 or S3-compatible storage (e.g., MinIO) with presigned or public-read objects.
- Google Cloud Storage with signed URLs or public buckets.
- Local static file server for development with publicly reachable tunneling when needed.

## Decision
Use an asset store abstraction that can emit public URLs regardless of provider. Delay choosing the concrete provider until later steps, while ensuring adapters can enforce JPEG mime type and retention policies.

## Consequences
- Positive: Flexibility to switch providers; aligns with Instagram requirement for public URLs; simplifies local testing with a dev server.
- Negative: Requires additional configuration per environment to ensure URLs are reachable; might introduce complexity around URL expiration if using signed URLs.
